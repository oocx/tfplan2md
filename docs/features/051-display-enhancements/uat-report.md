# UAT Report: Display Enhancements

## Status: ✅ Passed

## Date: 2026-01-27

## Environment
- **GitHub PR:** N/A (not executed)
- **Azure DevOps PR:** [#40](https://dev.azure.com/oocx/test/_git/test/pullrequest/40) (Status: Abandoned - Approved)

## Test Summary
UAT was executed on Azure DevOps using the APIM-specific demo artifact to validate summary formatting, named value masking, and large value rendering. Feedback about inline-diff syntax highlighting was reviewed and accepted as a tradeoff.

## Validation Results

### 1. APIM Operation Summary Formatting
- ✅ **Verified**: Summary renders as `users`/`get-profile` @ `apim-demo` in `📁 rg-apim-demo` with `display_name` included.

### 2. Named Values Sensitivity
- ✅ **Verified**: `secret=false` displays the real value.
- ✅ **Verified**: `secret=true` remains masked.

### 3. Large JSON/XML Rendering
- ✅ **Verified**: JSON/XML are pretty-printed with language fences for create/delete.
- ✅ **Verified**: Inline diffs show formatted changes (no fenced syntax highlighting, accepted tradeoff).

### 4. Subscription Attribute Emoji
- ✅ **Verified**: `subscription_id`/`subscription` show 🔑 in change tables.
- ⚠️ **Note**: No summary line in this artifact includes subscription attributes, so summary context could not be verified.

## Conclusion
All requested behavior is validated on Azure DevOps with the APIM demo artifact. The inline-diff + syntax highlighting limitation is documented and accepted for this release.
