# Watch UAT PR (GitHub)

## Purpose
UAT comment polling is historically brittle. This skill standardizes the watch loop so the agent can reliably wait for Maintainer feedback/approval.

Preferred: use GitHub chat tools to poll PR state + comments (avoids terminal output/pager issues).
Fallback: use the stable wrapper command.

Fallback path uses the repo wrapper script `scripts/uat-watch-github.sh`, which repeatedly calls `scripts/uat-github.sh poll` until:
- approval keywords are detected, or
- the PR is closed/merged, or
- a timeout is reached.

## Hard Rules
### Must
- Use `scripts/uat-watch-github.sh` (single stable command).
- Treat any detected approval (`approved|passed|accept|lgtm`) as UAT passed.
- Stop watching and report when the PR is closed.

### Must Not
- Spam comments or post follow-ups while waiting.
- Run many ad-hoc `gh` commands; prefer the wrapper.

## Actions

### Preferred: Poll using GitHub chat tools
Repeatedly:
- Fetch PR details (state)
- Fetch PR conversation comments
- Stop and report if the PR is closed/merged
- Treat any detected approval (`approved|passed|accept|lgtm`) as UAT passed

### Fallback: One-command wrapper

### 1. Watch the PR
```bash
scripts/uat-watch-github.sh <pr-number>
```

### 2. Optional: Tune polling interval / timeout
```bash
scripts/uat-watch-github.sh <pr-number> --interval-seconds 60 --timeout-seconds 3600
```

## Output
- Exit code `0`: approval detected or PR closed (treat as pass)
- Exit code `1`: timed out (treat as incomplete; ask Maintainer)
