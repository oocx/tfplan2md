# Copilot Instructions

This document provides generic guidelines for AI agents.

For project-specific instructions, refer to the `docs/spec.md` file in the repository.

## Coding Pattern Preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid adding code for features not explicitly requested
- Avoid overengineering solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid having files over 200–300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.

## Coding Workflow Preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- Only make changes and give answers with high confidence. "I don't know" is an acceptable answer when you are not sure about something
- When asking the user for more information, focus on one topic at a time
- When you have follow-up questions, ask them one at a time, and wait for the answer before asking the next question. **Never list multiple questions or considerations at once, even in plans or summaries.**
- Always ensure that you have up-to-date information. Use web search if you think that your information might be outdated (example: new versions of frameworks, libraries, tools, etc.)
- Use pre-commit hooks and linters to ensure code quality and consistency
- Do not edit CHANGELOG.md under any circumstances; changelog entries are generated by Versionize in CI. (strict)
- Create feature branches for all changes that follow the convention described in the documentation
- After implementing changes, ensure that the documentation is updated accordingly

## Agent Skills (Required)

- Agent Skills are the source of truth for how to perform recurring workflow tasks correctly.
- Skills live under `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Before performing any non-trivial workflow task (for example: PR creation/merge, rebase, resolving merge conflicts, UAT, release steps, demo artifact generation, architecture documentation updates), you must:
  1. Search for a relevant skill under `.github/skills/`.
  2. If a relevant skill exists, follow it instead of improvising.
  3. If you are unsure which skill applies or the intent is unclear, ask the user questions until it is clear.

Note: `docs/agents.md` is a helpful index, but `.github/skills/` is the authoritative list of skills.

## Plan Mode Instructions
- Continue to ask for more details until you have a clear understanding of the requirements
- Only ask one question at a time
- If you offer alternative solutions, show the pros and cons of each alternative, include examples (if applicable) and recommend one. Include the reason for your recommendation.
- Summarize your understanding of the requirements before you start coding
- After the plan is approved, and before the implementation starts, create architecture decision records (ADRs) for any significant design decisions. 

## Documentation
- Ensure that you follow instructions from the `docs/spec.md` and other documentation files in the /docs folder
- Ensure that all documentation files are updated with any code changes
- Ensure that all documentation files are consistent with each, do not contradict each other and do not contain outdated information
- When writing documentation, ensure that it is clear, concise, and easy to understand
- Ensure that the implementation and the documentation are aligned with each other

## Fixing Bugs
- Before you fix a bug, you always must first create at least one test that catches the incorrect behavior. Do not start fixing the bug before you were able to detect the bug with a test.
  
## Code Style Perferences
- Follow the Common C# Coding conventions ([code style](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions))
- Use `_camelCase` naming convention for private fields (e.g., `private readonly bool _showSensitive`)
- Prefer immutable data structures (`IReadOnlyList<T>`, `IReadOnlyDictionary<K,V>`) over mutable types (`List<T>`, `Dictionary<K,V>`) when modification is not required
- Prefer modern C# language features when they improve readability:
  - Collection expressions: `List<string> items = [];` instead of `new List<string>()`
  - Primary constructors for simple dependency injection
  - Pattern matching with `is`, `is not`, `and`, `or`
  - Target-typed `new()` when type is apparent
  - Expression-bodied members for simple single-line implementations
- Code Style enforcement must be automated (pre-commit hooks, CI/CD checks, .editorconfig etc.)

## Terminal Command Guidelines

- **Explain then Execute**: Before executing any terminal command, briefly state what the command does and why you need to run it.
- **Do NOT ask for permission in chat**: Immediately follow your explanation with the tool call in the same response. The user will use the VS Code UI buttons to Allow or Deny the command.
  - Bad: "I will run `git status`. Is that okay?" (waits for user reply)
  - Bad: "I will run `git status`." (waits for user reply)
  - Good: "I will run `git status` to check changes." [Tool Call]
- **Pager Suppression**: Always prevent interactive pagers from blocking execution.
  - For `gh`: Use `GH_PAGER=cat GH_FORCE_TTY=false gh ...` or `export GH_PAGER=cat GH_FORCE_TTY=false`.
  - For `az`: Use `AZURE_CORE_PAGER=cat az ...` or `export AZURE_CORE_PAGER=cat`.
  - For general tools: Use `export PAGER=cat`.
- **Test hangs**: When running the full test suite, use the timeout wrapper instead of calling `dotnet test` directly.
  - Example: `scripts/test-with-timeout.sh -- dotnet test --no-build --configuration Release --verbosity normal`
  - If you need a different timeout: `scripts/test-with-timeout.sh --timeout-seconds <seconds> -- dotnet test ...`
- **Snapshot updates**: Snapshot diffs (files under `tests/Oocx.TfPlan2Md.Tests/TestData/Snapshots/`) must be intentional.
  - Include the token `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_OK` in at least one commit message in the PR and explain why the snapshot changes are correct.
  - To regenerate snapshots intentionally, use `scripts/update-test-snapshots.sh`.
- **Option selection**: If you present the user with an option list and the user replies with a number (e.g., `1`), that number always refers to the **most recent** option list you presented.
  - Never apply a numeric answer to an older option list.
  - If there is any ambiguity (e.g., multiple option lists were presented, the numbering changed, or the user response doesn’t map cleanly), ask for confirmation instead of guessing.
- **Directly-invokable scripts**: Always run repository scripts directly (e.g., `scripts/uat-run.sh`, `scripts/pr-github.sh`, `scripts/validate-agents.py`) instead of via an interpreter/runner (e.g., `bash scripts/<script>.sh`, `python3 scripts/<script>.py`, `dotnet <runner> scripts/<script>`).
  - This enables per-script permanent allow rules in VS Code approvals.
  - If a script is not directly invokable, fix it instead of working around it (add a proper shebang and make it executable).
  - Exception: interpreter tracing is allowed only for debugging (e.g., `bash -x ...`).
- **Workspace-local temp files**: Do not create or reference temporary files outside the repository (for example `/tmp` or `~/`). If a scratch file is needed, write it under `.tmp/` (create it with `scripts/setup-tmp.sh` if needed).
- Avoid running commands that are not necessary for the current task.
- When a command fails, explain the error and propose a solution before retrying.

## Tooling specific instructions
- For instructions on how to use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) in automated agents, refer to the `.github/gh-cli-instructions.md` file in the repository
- **Always use project scripts** instead of raw commands when available:
  - PR creation/merge: Use `scripts/pr-github.sh` instead of `gh pr create` or `gh pr merge`
  - UAT execution: Use `scripts/uat-run.sh` instead of manual commands
  - The scripts handle repository-specific policies and conventions
