# Code Review: Display Enhancements

## Summary

This review covers the Display Enhancements feature (051) which introduces four focused improvements to enhance readability and provide better context in generated reports: syntax highlighting for large JSON/XML values, enriched API Management subresource summaries, named values sensitivity override when `secret=false`, and subscription attributes emoji (🔑).

The implementation follows the updated architecture by properly separating generic code in `MarkdownGeneration/` from provider-specific code in `Providers/AzureRM/`. The code quality is high with comprehensive test coverage and proper documentation.

## Verification Results

- **Tests:** **FAILED** (655 passed, 3 failed)
  - 3 snapshot tests failed due to intentional changes in comprehensive demo output
  - New APIM resources added to test data
  - Root cause: Snapshots not regenerated yet
- **Coverage:** Not measured (tests must pass first)
- **Build:** Success
- **Docker:** Builds successfully
- **Errors:** 
  - 4 minor SonarLint suggestions (code duplication warnings in test files, cognitive complexity warning in SemanticFormatting.cs)
  - These are not blocking issues
- **Markdownlint:** 0 errors (comprehensive demo passes)

## Review Decision

**Status:** Changes Requested

## Snapshot Changes

- **Snapshot files changed:** Yes (3 snapshots need regeneration)
  - `summary-template.md`
  - `comprehensive-demo.md`
  - (Implied: any other snapshots affected by comprehensive demo changes)
- **Commit message token `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_OK` present:** **No** ❌
- **Why the snapshot diff is correct:** The comprehensive demo test data (`examples/comprehensive-demo/plan.json`) was intentionally updated to include:
  1. `azurerm_api_management_api_operation.get_profile` - to demonstrate enriched APIM operation summaries with `display_name`, `operation_id`, `api_name`, `api_management_name`, plus JSON/XML syntax highlighting for `policy_content` and `policy_xml` attributes
  2. `azurerm_api_management_named_value.client_id` - to demonstrate the named value sensitivity override (showing actual value when `secret=false`) and APIM named value summary enrichment
  3. `azurerm_subscription.demo` - to demonstrate the 🔑 emoji prefix for `subscription_id` and `subscription` attributes
  
  These additions increase the "Add" count from 12 to 15 resources and the total from 23 to 26, which explains the diff in the summary table. The new resources appear in the output with all four feature enhancements correctly applied.

## Issues Found

### Blockers

**B1: Missing SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_OK token**
- **File:** N/A (commit messages)
- **Issue:** The snapshot files need to be regenerated due to intentional test data changes, but no commit message includes the required `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_OK` token.
- **Impact:** 3 tests fail, preventing the test suite from passing.
- **Fix:** 
  1. Run `scripts/update-test-snapshots.sh` to regenerate snapshots
  2. Review the snapshot diffs to confirm they match the expected output
  3. Commit with message including `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_OK` token and explanation (e.g., "test: update snapshots for display enhancements demo SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_OK - Added APIM resources to demonstrate summary enrichment, sensitivity override, and syntax highlighting")

### Major Issues

None

### Minor Issues

**M1: Code duplication in test files**
- **File:** [src/tests/Oocx.TfPlan2Md.TUnit/MarkdownGeneration/ScribanHelpersLargeValueTests.cs](../../../src/tests/Oocx.TfPlan2Md.TUnit/MarkdownGeneration/ScribanHelpersLargeValueTests.cs)
- **Issue:** SonarLint suggests defining constants for repeated literals "simple-diff", "value", "before", "after"
- **Impact:** Minor code smell, does not affect functionality
- **Fix:** Extract constants at class level (optional)

**M2: Cognitive complexity warning**
- **File:** [src/Oocx.TfPlan2Md/MarkdownGeneration/Helpers/ScribanHelpers/SemanticFormatting.cs](../../../src/Oocx.TfPlan2Md/MarkdownGeneration/Helpers/ScribanHelpers/SemanticFormatting.cs#L155)
- **Issue:** `FormatAttributeValue` method has cognitive complexity 16 (threshold: 15)
- **Impact:** Slightly harder to understand, but method is well-structured with clear helper methods
- **Fix:** Consider extracting additional helper method(s) to reduce complexity (optional)

### Suggestions

None - the implementation is clean and well-structured.

### Detailed Assessment

**Correctness:**
- ✅ All four acceptance criteria from the specification are implemented
- ✅ JSON detection, pretty-printing, and `json` language fence work correctly
- ✅ XML detection, pretty-printing, and `xml` language fence work correctly
- ✅ Already-formatted content preservation heuristic works
- ✅ APIM operation summaries include all required context
- ✅ APIM named value summaries include `api_management_name`
- ✅ Named values with `secret=false` display actual values
- ✅ Named values with `secret=true` remain masked
- ✅ 🔑 emoji appears for `subscription_id` and `subscription` attributes
- ✅ Docker image builds successfully
- ⚠️ Test snapshots need regeneration (blocker)
- ✅ Comprehensive demo output passes markdownlint (0 errors)

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Follows C# coding conventions
- ✅ Uses `_camelCase` for private fields (e.g., `_resourceType`, `_largeValueFormat`)
- ✅ Uses modern C# features appropriately (collection expressions, target-typed new, pattern matching)
- ✅ Files are under 300 lines (largest is AzureRMApimSummaryBuilder at ~134 lines)
- ✅ No unnecessary code duplication between generic and provider-specific code
- ✅ Prefers immutable data structures where appropriate

**Access Modifiers:**
- ✅ Provider-specific factories use `internal sealed` (most restrictive for assembly-internal components)
- ✅ Helper methods use `private static` appropriately
- ✅ No unnecessary `public` members except required interface implementations
- ✅ No false API backwards compatibility concerns

**Code Comments:**
- ✅ All public/internal members have XML doc comments
- ✅ Private helper methods have meaningful doc comments
- ✅ Comments explain "why" (e.g., "Resolves the state object to use for summary generation based on the action")
- ✅ Required tags present: `<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`
- ✅ Feature references included (e.g., "Related feature: docs/features/051-display-enhancements/specification.md")
- ✅ Comments are synchronized with code

**Architecture:**
- ✅ **Excellent adherence to architectural constraints:** Provider-specific logic (APIM summaries, named value sensitivity override) is correctly implemented in `Providers/AzureRM/` using `IResourceViewModelFactory`
- ✅ Generic code in `MarkdownGeneration/` correctly provides extension points without embedding provider logic
- ✅ `ReportModelBuilder` properly respects factory-set `SummaryHtml` (checks if already set before building default)
- ✅ Large value formatting and subscription emoji are correctly implemented in generic code (apply to all providers)
- ✅ No resource type checks (e.g., `azurerm_*`) in generic code
- ✅ Factories properly registered in `AzureRMModule.RegisterFactories`
- ✅ Changes align with the updated architecture document

**Testing:**
- ✅ Comprehensive unit test coverage for all features:
  - TC-01: JSON detection and formatting ✅
  - TC-02: XML detection and formatting ✅
  - TC-03: Already-formatted preservation ✅

  - TC-08: Named value masking when `secret=true` ✅
  - TC-09: Subscription attribute emoji in all contexts ✅
  - TC-11: ReportModelBuilder respects factory-provided SummaryHtml ✅
- ✅ Tests follow naming convention: `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult`
- ✅ All tests are fully automated
- ✅ Integration test (comprehensive demo) validates end-to-end behavior
- ⚠️ 3 snapshot tests fail (expected, needs regeneration)

**Documentation:**
- ✅ Specification clearly defines all four enhancements with before/after examples
- ✅ Architecture document properly describes the separation between generic and provider-specific code
- ✅ Tasks document accurately reflects the implementation order and completion status
- ✅ Test plan covers all acceptance criteria with appropriate test cases

- ✅ UAT report documents successful validation on Azure DevOps
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md was NOT modified (correct - auto-generated)
- ✅ Documentation is consistent across all files
- ✅ No contradictions between spec, architecture, tasks, and test plan
- ✅ Comprehensive demo artifact is up-to-date and passes markdownlint

## Next Steps

### For Developer Agent:

1. **Regenerate test snapshots:**
   ```bash
   scripts/update-test-snapshots.sh
   ```

2. **Review the snapshot diffs** to confirm they match the expected comprehensive demo output with:
   - 3 new APIM resources (api_operation, named_value, subscription)
   - JSON/XML syntax highlighting in policy attributes
   - Enriched APIM summaries with display_name, operation_id, api_name, api_management_name
   - Named value showing actual value (not masked) when secret=false
   - 🔑 emoji on subscription attributes

3. **Commit the updated snapshots:**
   ```bash
   git add src/tests/Oocx.TfPlan2Md.TUnit/TestData/Snapshots/*.md
   git commit -m "test: update snapshots for display enhancements demo SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_OK

   Added three APIM resources to comprehensive demo to validate:
   - Syntax highlighting for large JSON/XML values (policy_content, policy_xml)
   - Enriched APIM operation summary with display_name, operation_id, api_name, api_management_name
   - Named value sensitivity override (shows actual value when secret=false)
   - Subscription attribute emoji (🔑) for subscription_id and subscription

   Summary counts updated: Add 12→15, Total 23→26"
   git push origin HEAD
   ```

4. **Re-run tests** to verify all pass:
   ```bash
   scripts/test-with-timeout.sh -- dotnet test --solution src/tfplan2md.slnx
   ```

5. **Hand off to Code Reviewer** for re-approval after snapshots are committed.

### Optional improvements (non-blocking):

- Consider extracting constants in [ScribanHelpersLargeValueTests.cs](../../../src/tests/Oocx.TfPlan2Md.TUnit/MarkdownGeneration/ScribanHelpersLargeValueTests.cs) for repeated test literals (M1)
- Consider refactoring [SemanticFormatting.cs](../../../src/Oocx.TfPlan2Md/MarkdownGeneration/Helpers/ScribanHelpers/SemanticFormatting.cs#L155) to reduce cognitive complexity (M2)

## Conclusion

This is an **excellent implementation** that properly follows the architectural constraints and provides high-quality code with comprehensive test coverage. The separation between generic and provider-specific code is exemplary, and all four feature enhancements work correctly as demonstrated in the comprehensive demo output.

The only blocking issue is the missing snapshot regeneration and commit message token. Once the snapshots are updated and committed with the `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_OK` token, this feature will be ready for release.
