# Retrospective: Universal Azure Resource ID Formatting

## Draft Notes

- **Issue:** When the user confirmed the test plan was ready for handoff (Option 1), the agent immediately started creating the task list instead of providing a clear handoff summary first. The user expected a summary before the next agent (Task Planner) started work.
- **Issue:** The Technical Writer agent incorrectly overwrote the `retrospective.md` file with a feature summary. Retrospective files should only be modified by the Retrospective agent to preserve draft notes and process feedback.
